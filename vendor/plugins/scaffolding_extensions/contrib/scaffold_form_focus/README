This allows you to auto focus the page to the first form field.

To use this, add the .js file to public/javascripts, and modify the layout to
include the javascript file after the scaffolded form:

  <%= javascript_include_tag('scaffold_form_focus') if @scaffold_class || @scaffold_update_page %>

The if statement makes it take effect for the scaffolded pages (which define
one of the two variables).  Note that the code is fairly simplistic, it just
focuses on the first text input, password input, textarea, or
select box on the page, so if your layout has a form before the scaffolded
form, you'll probably want to modify the code.
