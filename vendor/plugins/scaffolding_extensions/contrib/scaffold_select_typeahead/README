This allows you to add a typeahead feature to select boxes in scaffolded forms.

To use this, add the .js file to public/javascripts and add the following code
to the head section of the layout:

  <%= javascript_include_tag 'select' %>
  
Then apply the patch to the plugin (or modify it manually):

  cd RAILS_ROOT/vendor/plugins/scaffolding_extensions
  patch -p0 < contrib/scaffold_select_typeahead/scaffolding_extensions.rb.patch

If you have a very large number of records, you may want to consider using
autocompleting instead, as it doesn't send all records to the client.
