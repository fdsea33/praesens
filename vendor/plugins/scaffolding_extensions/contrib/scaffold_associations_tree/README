This allows you to change the scaffolded display of associated items in the
edit view from a simple list to a explorer-style clickable tree.

To use this, add the .js file to public/javascripts, the .css file to 
public/stylesheets, the .gif files to public/images and add the following code
to the head section of the layout:

  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'scaffold_associations_tree' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'scaffold_associations_tree' %>
  
Then add this to environment.rb:

  ActiveRecord::Base.scaffold_association_list_class = 'scaffold_associations_tree'
